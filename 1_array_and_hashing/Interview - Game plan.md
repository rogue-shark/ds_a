Got you.
I’ll build a **fresh, realistic, slow-learner-friendly plan** that fits your *6 hours today* + *4 hours tomorrow morning*, while still covering EVERYTHING that matters for this React/Node + HLD/LLD interview.

We’ll balance *depth* (because you like understanding internals) and *coverage* (because time is limited).

Here is the **clean updated plan**:

---

# ✅ **TODAY — 6 HOURS TOTAL**

## **⏳ BLOCK 1 — 4 HOURS — “Most Asked LeetCode for React/Node Interviews”**

**Goal:** Build confidence on the *patterns* that 90% of interview problems come from.

You will study **concept → 1–2 representative problems → generalize pattern**
So you can solve other unseen ones.

### **Hour 1 — Arrays + Hashing (High frequency)**

**Concepts:**

* Hash maps
* Frequency maps
* Two pointers
* Sorting + greedy

**Problems to solve:**

1. Two Sum
2. Valid Anagram
3. Group Anagrams
4. Top K Frequent Elements

**Ability gained:**
Handle 80% of “array + hashing + frequency” questions.

---

### **Hour 2 — Sliding Window + Two Pointers**

**Concepts:**

* Expanding window
* Shrinking window
* Max/min substring patterns

**Problems to solve:**

1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
2. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
3. Minimum Window Substring (watch explanation, not solve fully)

**Ability gained:**
You can now solve ANY substring/window-based problem.

---

### **Hour 3 — Linked Lists + Stacks**

**Concepts:**

* Fast/slow pointers
* Reverse
* Cycle detection
* Stack for “valid/invalid structures”

**Problems to solve:**

1. Reverse Linked List
2. Merge Two Sorted Lists
3. Linked List Cycle
4. Valid Parentheses

**Ability gained:**
You can now handle all pointer-based and stack-based logic questions.

---

### **Hour 4 — Trees + Intervals (must know)**

**Concepts:**

* BFS/DFS
* Level order traversal
* Interval merging logic

**Problems to solve:**

1. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (BFS)
2. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
3. Merge Intervals
4. Meeting Rooms / Meeting Rooms II (watch pattern)

**Ability gained:**
You’re ready for all “tree traversal” + “sorting + merging” questions.

---

# 🔥 If you finish these 16 problems properly (conceptually),

you can solve *80% of mid-level interview problems* even if unseen.

---

# ✅ **BLOCK 2 — 1 HOUR — OOP, SOLID, SFSO patterns**

**1. OOP (15 min)**

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Real example: Car + Engine + Driver roles

**2. SOLID (25 min)**
Short examples for each

* SRP
* OCP
* LSP
* ISP
* DIP

**3. Patterns (20 min)**
Learn only **4 patterns** which are commonly asked:

* Strategy
* Observer
* Singleton
* Factory

**4. Quick LLD warmup (10 min)**
Design a basic URL Shortener class diagram.
(Just classes + methods + DB schema)

---

# ✅ **BLOCK 3 — 1 HOUR — React + Node Concepts (Internals + Most Asked)**

### **React (30 minutes)**

* Virtual DOM
* Reconciliation
* useEffect lifecycle
* useState batching
* Why useEffect runs twice (React 18 strict mode)
* useMemo vs useCallback vs memo
* Controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Context API vs Redux
* How to avoid re-renders
* Why keys matter

### **Node (30 minutes)**

* Event loop: microtasks vs macrotasks
* Why Node is single-threaded but scalable
* Express middleware lifecycle
* Auth: JWT (access + refresh tokens)
* Scaling Node:

  * PM2 cluster
  * Load balancer
  * Caching (Redis)
* API rate limiting
* Error handling (async + global middleware)

# ⭐ **Summary of Today**

Total time: **6 hours**

| Block   | Time    | Subject                                  |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Block 1 | 4 hours | DSA most asked (16 problems, 5 concepts) |
| Block 2 | 1 hour  | OOP + SOLID + 4 design patterns          |
| Block 3 | 1 hour  | React + Node internals, most-asked       |

This is balanced: deep + concentrated + strategic.

# ✅ **TOMORROW MORNING (7AM–11AM) — 4 HOURS**

## **⏳ BLOCK 1 — 2 HOURS — High-Level System Design (HLD)**

We will cover structure + templates + 2 fully solved designs.

### **Hour 1 — HLD Foundations**

* Requirements (functional + non-functional)
* API design
* Architecture
* Load balancing
* Caching
* Database choice
* Sharding vs replication
* Queues (Kafka/SQS)
* CDN
* Rate limiting

Create your reusable **HLD template**:

1. Clarify requirements
2. Define APIs
3. High-level architecture
4. Database model
5. Scaling strategy
6. Caching strategy
7. Fault tolerance
8. Bottlenecks + trade-offs

### **Hour 2 — Two full HLD designs**

1. **URL Shortener**
2. **Instagram Feed / Twitter Timeline**

Explain:

* Diagram
* Storage
* Caching
* Queues
* Scaling
* Bottlenecks

---

## **⏳ BLOCK 2 — 2 HOURS — LLD Practice + UML**

### **Hour 3 — UML + Class Design**
